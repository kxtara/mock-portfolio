## Overview

This project is a personal portfolio webpage that I really enjoyed taking part in.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

As usual, I started by laying out my HTML. I found this project a little bit harder than others because of the sizing, but then I realized what I was doing wrong, so I changed up a few things.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

During this project, I became more comfortable using Flexbox. I also learned more about making a navigation bar.

### Continued development

Moving forward, I want to continue learning about accessibility, grid, CSS transforms, and much more.
